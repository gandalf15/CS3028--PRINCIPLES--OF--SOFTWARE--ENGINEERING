Summary:
    * It should be fine for us to use any sofware licensed under the BSD licenses, the Boost License, The ISC license,
      the MIT license, the Microsoft Public License, The Unlicense, or the Do What the Fuck You Want To Public License
    * If we want to use sofware with an Academic Free, Apache, Artistic, or Zlib license, we must consider whether we
      mind stating what changes we have made to the code
    * We MAY NOT use any software licensed under any version of any GNU license ( that is, the Affero GPL, the GPL,
      or the LGPL ).
    * We also MAY NOT use software licensed under the Eclipse Public License, The European Union Public License,
      the LaTeX Project Public License, the Mozilla Public license, the Microsoft Reciprocal License,
      the SIL Open Font License, or the Open Software license.
    * We may use software licensed under the Creative Commons Zero license, but it is not recommended for software.
    * We will need to discuss any other open-source license

From http://choosealicense.com/appendix/, and skipping columns that include every license:

* IANAL, so have no idea about the "Patent Use" column[1].
* We don't want to disclose the source code, thus we are limited to:
    AFL v3.0
    Apache 2.0
    Artistic License 2.0
    BSD 2-clause
    BSD 3-clause
    BSD 3-clause revised
    Boost 1.0
    CC-BY 4.0
    CC-SA 4.0
    CC-0 1.0 univ.
    ISC
    MIT
    Microsoft PL
    SIL Open Font 1.1
    The Unlicense
    WTFPL
    zlib
* I don't think we care about the license and copyright notice; there's no reason to to include a notice about
  the software we've used in our product.
* We don't want Network Use is Distribution; then we'd have to give our software to users, AFAIK, but this changes nothing
* We want to be able to release under a different license; therefore we have to rule out the CC-SA, and the
  SIL Open Font license.
* I would prefer not to have to write a notice about changes we've made to code; however, this excludes the AFL, the Apache,
  the artistic license, CC-BY, and zlib. (SC)
* We don't care about liability, because no developer in their right mind is going to have a warranty on free software
* We don't care about trademark use, because we're not going to be using their trademarks.

Therefore, we are left with the BSD licenses, the Boost license, Creative commons Zero, ISC, MIT, Microsoft Public License,
and the WTFPL.

If we don't mind stating changes made to the code used, we can use the Academic Free License, and Apache, the Artistic
license, Creative commons Attributative, and the zlib.

* The difference between the BSD licenses is minimal; the big difference being that we can't use the name of the copyright
  holder for promotion, which I'm sure we weren't planning to do anyway
* The boost library doesn't really require anything, and from a read-through, is good for our purposes
* The CC0 basically places one's work into the public domain, but is innapropriate for software.
* The ISC is functionally equivalent to the BSD 2-clause and the MIT.

Footnotes:
[1] Note: software is technically not regarded as an invention in the UK; having said that:
        1.  The UKIPO regularly grants software patents - It's a bit confusing, and again, IANAL, but it does happen
        2.  Other countries allow software patents, for example the US. If we have a view to release our product elsewhere,
            we have to respect their laws, esp. as we are targeting governmental institutions
