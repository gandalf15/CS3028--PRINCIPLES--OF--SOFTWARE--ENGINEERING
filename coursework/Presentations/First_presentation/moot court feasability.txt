Feasability - moot court

( these are *VERY* perliminary notes - I'm of course will to do more work on them tomorrow, but I'm a bit stuck for time today )

* In terms of simply parsing the documents into some internal structure, this should be fairly easy - a simple dump to plain text of an example pdf we would be working with shows a fairly regular structure that could be parsed (although it is perhaps not a regular or context-free grammar). From talks with our guide, all moot court notes should be in this form.

* The frontend should also be fairly easy - it really only needs to do some calls into a database

* However, I think that the main problem will be the natural language parsing - that is extracting the meaning from the documents; it should be easier than normal NLP, since it is written very formally, but it's still a hard problem to solve (and due to the formality, we I don't think there's much chance of using off-the-shelf NLP without modification

* Certainly, within the university, there is demand for this - we have been asked to do this specifically because the law department wants software to do this
* I think it is also fairly safe to assume that other universities would therefore be interested in it
* It could also provide a base for dealing with many other sorts of formal documents where there is a specific format

-- --

* I am a bit apprehensive about completion time - I think the NLP will take a long time, and due to the speed and correctness requirements, it will need a lot of manual testing - I can't conceive of written tests to tell if the output of some NLP algorithm is correct

commercial
  ( is there a unique selling proposition
  , would people be prepared to buy into it
  , would income exceed expenditure) and organizational
    ( cay YOU do it as a team of five developers working P/T for a limited amount of time
      [ preliminary from now to end November
      , development: from mid January to end April
      ]
