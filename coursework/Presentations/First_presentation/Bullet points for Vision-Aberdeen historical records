Bullet points for Vision - Law in the Aberdeen Council Registers
(Just a first draft, any feedback is welcome. Also as it is only 2 bullet points I wasnt sure as to how long it should be. If it is to 
short let me know and i can expand on them more.)

What will the system provide?
The system will provide a web interface that lets users search through the Historical Records. The users will define their search fields 
to which the system will return any passages or pieces of text that match the search criteria.

Tangible Benefits 
Once the our system has been developed it will not only benefit Aberdeen. Aslong as the text being transcibed  into XML our system can be 
used on historical records all over the world.
