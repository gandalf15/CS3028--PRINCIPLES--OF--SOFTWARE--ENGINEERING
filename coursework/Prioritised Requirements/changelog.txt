    * Initial document created from:
        1. CS3028-CHARLIE/coursework/Presentations/Third_presentation/Functional
           Requirments Revised.odt
        2. CS3028-CHARLIE/coursework/Presentations/Third_presentation/Non-functional
           Requirements.odt
    
    * Some requirements specified as sub-requirements of others (specifically, the various
      requirements to do with search input are now sub-requirements of the search
      requirement)
    
    * Initial re-ordering of requirements
    
    * Added the requirement to be able to search for plain text, replacing the requirement
      to search for a specific word, as I think users want to be able to search for whole
      strings, and this includes searching for single words
    
    * Added footnotes with my rationale for ranking - these will obviously be removed when
      we've agreed about everything
    
    * re-phrased the user groups from the non-functional requirements
    
    * re-phrased the non-functional requirement about upload speed (mainly, I think we
      just want "if" as opposed to "if and only if", since, to get a download in 5 seconds,
      it is sufficient to have a 1Mbps connection, but not necessary; we just don't
      guaruntee it.
    
    * Added a preamble to specify that we will be using SI units of measurement
